# Image Processing Fundamentals

This repository contains a basic image processing assignment implemented using Python and OpenCV in Google Colab.

## 📌 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 📷 Input Image
A sample color image is used as the input for all image processing steps.

## 🔹 Image Processing Steps
1. Original Image Acquisition
2. Grayscale Conversion
3. Image Resizing
4. Gaussian Blur (Noise Reduction)
5. Edge Detection (Canny)
6. Thresholding
7. Histogram Equalization

## 🎯 Objective
To understand and demonstrate fundamental image processing operations with proper visualization and justification.

## 📂 Files Included
- `Image_Processing_Assignment.ipynb` – Complete implementation
- `input.jpg` – Input image

## 👨‍🎓 Academic Use
This project was created as part of a Component Assessment for educational purposes.
